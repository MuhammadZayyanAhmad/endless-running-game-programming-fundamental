# C++ Endless Running Game

## Overview
The C++ Endless Running Game is a simple, engaging game where players control a character represented by 'X'. The objective is to navigate through a dynamically generated board filled with obstacles ('#') and collectible coins ('O'). The game tracks essential player metrics such as health, score, and distance traveled, providing an immersive gaming experience.

## Features
- **Player Movement**: Move the character in four directionsâ€”up, down, left, or right.
- **Dynamic Obstacles**: Obstacles move towards the player, increasing the game's difficulty.
- **Collectible Coins**: Gather coins to boost your score and enhance gameplay.
- **Health Management**: Players begin with three health points. Collisions with obstacles decrease health.
- **Distance Tracking**: The distance traveled by the player is calculated based on the elapsed time.
- **High Score Saving**: High scores are saved and displayed at the end of each game session.

## Technical Details
This game demonstrates fundamental C++ concepts, including:
- **Arrays**: Utilized for managing the game board and tracking player positions.
- **Random Number Generation**: Employed to create dynamic obstacle placements and coin appearances.
- **File Handling**: Used to save and retrieve high scores, allowing players to track their progress over time.
